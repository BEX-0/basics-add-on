    <p>
        I'm not an artist, nor do I apire to be one. But doodling in a sketchbook from time to time has become a very productive use of my time. 
        It was once suggested to me to draw in my spare time to reduce stress. I was skeptical at first, but It grew on me quickly.
        I now have a cool hobby that helps me unwind and encourages creativity. Also, my line work has <em>definetely</em> improved.
